We'll make a CRUD app from scratch.

Create a new rails app 
>rails new [name]

Go into your app directory
>cd [name]

Create controllers, the C in MVC
>rails generate controller Posts 

This creates a controller file, and a corresponding views folder

Go into your newly created controller and create your first action: index
>def index
  end

Now make a corresponding view file in the posts/views folder
index.html.erb
> <h1>Hello World</h1>

Now create a route
//in routes.rb
resouces :posts

This creates index, new, show, create, edit, update, and destroy routes

Take a look
>rails s

Generate a model
>rails generate model Post title:string content:text

This creates our model and migration

Migrate the DB
>rails db:migrate

Make some posts in the console
>rails c

>post = Post.new(title:'first post', content:'blahblahblah')
// You can also use hashes for the attributes
Save with post.save
Also can create a post in one step with .create

Can retrieve this post using .find. 
>post = Post.find(1)

Can update with .update_attribute and parameters to update
>post.update_attribute('content','new content')

Destroy with .destroy
>post.destroy

Check routes 
>rails routes

This should show all your actions

Create these actions in your controller
>def show
  end
  def new
  end
  def create
  end
  def edit
  end
  def update 
  end
  def destroy
  end

Create corresponding views: show, new, edit in views/posts folder
